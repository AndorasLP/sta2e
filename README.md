# Star Trek Adventures 2nd Edition (UNOFFICIAL)
An ***UNOFFICIAL*** implementation of Star Trek Adventures Roleplaying Game (2nd Edition) for Foundry VTT

## Special Thanks
- [Mike Schoen](https://github.com/mkscho63/sta) for the original implementation of STA for Foundry VTT
- [FabulistVtt](https://github.com/FabulistVtt/sta-lcars-ui) for the fancy LCARS CSS module for STA & Foundry VTT
- Modiphius for creating Star Trek Adventures

## FAQ

**Is this System out yet?**
- STA 2E is still in the Pre-Order phase, so I don't have full access to the full rules yet. That means this package/implementation is still very much in the WIP phase!

**How does this system work?**
- If you're familiar with the 1st Edition implementation of STA, then you already know 90% of how to get things to work. If you're not, I encourage you to play around a bit before giving me a poke on Discord. I (*elhmk1*) can be found in the Official Modiphius Discord as well as the Foundry VTT one.

**What's changed from the 1st Edition?**
- Specifically...
  - Challenge Dice have been removed from the system completely. There may be some lingering files from the 1st Edition Implementation but they are not used.
  - Determination now turns the first die in the dice pool to a Critical Success (1) rather than adding a whole new die to the dice pool
  - Character Stress is now based on Fitness unless a Talent specifies otherwise. There is also now a Maximum Stress Modifier field for further tweaking
  - There is also now a Maximum Shield Modifier field for tweaking Starship sheets
  - There is now a Dedicated Focus option when rolling
  - Ships no longer track Power. They now have a singular metacurrency known as "Reserve Power" that you either have or you don't
  - Weapons now display the tags selected in their item container when rolling
  - And much more!

**I have found an issue! How do I report it?**
- Report it here on Github or give me a poke in Discord. Make sure to include as much detail as possible so I can help narrow down what's gone wrong! That said, I might not be able to fix things depending on how involved the error is due to my inexperience in coding.

**Can you include [X] in future releases?**
- I know *just* enough coding to have made all the changes to Mike Schoen's work for this implementation. Chances are you might know more than I do about implementing whatever it is you're after!

**How much does this cost?**
- This is entirely free! I had heard that Mike Schoen wouldn't be able to continue work on their own implementation of STA for Foundry VTT and that no one else had stepped up to do STA 2E yet!
